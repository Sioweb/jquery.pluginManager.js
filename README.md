# Plugin Manager

This basic framework base on [jQuery Modul Dummy](https://github.com/Sioweb/jQueryModulDummy) which can be used to create fully configurable jQuery Plugins in no time with callbacks and methods.

First things first, you need to include `/pluginManager/jquery_plugin_manager.js`. You can change the path but never change the Filename. Do not merge the file into a uglyfied Script. It's required to get the correct plugin path.
